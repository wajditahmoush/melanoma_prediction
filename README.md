### Melanoma', also known as 'Malignant_Melanoma', is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur on the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles.
#### The In this assignment, we provide a multiclass classification model using a custom convolutional neural network in TensorFlow. 
#### We provided a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma with accuracy exceeding 80%. 
#### The solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
#### The solutiomn is trained using a dataset of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.


The solution classifies following diseases:

Actinic keratosis
Basal cell carcinoma
Dermatofibroma
Melanoma
Nevus
Pigmented benign keratosis
Seborrheic keratosis
Squamous cell carcinoma
Vascular lesion
